<p>The EQ project aims to use mobile application and web technology to gather data related to aspects of environmental pollution. This data will be gathered via a questionnaire accessible via a mobile application. User responses will be stored and presented in an aesthetically pleasing way via web interface. Our intention is to highlight any gap between peopleâ€™s perception of environmental pollution issues and the reality.</p>
<p>We think this could be important in raising awareness of the impact of environmental pollution and possibly a call to action to help people change their behaviour.</p>
<p>As well as the questionnaire responses, we intend to provide supporting/background information in the form of data visualisations. We believe this could add value to the project as well as providing some context for the areas on which we have chosen to concentrate.</p>
